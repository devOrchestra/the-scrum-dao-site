## Our Solution

With the number of ICO failures that have been recorded and the many faults inherent in the system, it is clearly apparent that an alternative approach is needed. The Scrum DAO offers an elegant and effective alternative to ICOs by combining our flexible software development methodology with a well-structured DAO framework.

### Concept
-------------
In the Scrum DAO, all the stakeholders in the development process are brought together under one entity which allows for greater interaction between investors and developers. Instead of an ICO campaign that releases ‘X’ token for ‘Y’ dollars, a token release approach that follows the completion of incremental milestones will be followed. New tokens are only released when some portion of the development work has been completed and approved by the DAO.

With ICOs, startups push an idea to the public and invite investors to buy into the idea by purchasing tokens. When the capital has been raised, the entrepreneurs and developers work on the concept without any input from investors. In the Scrum DAO, investors only put up money based on the amount of work that has been completed and verified. In this way, the project capitalization grows smoothly and in parallel with the implementation of the features of the project. Investors aren’t just paying for hype.


### The Scrum DAO Ecosystem
-------------
The Scrum DAO will be integrated with most of the popular project management systems like Github and JIRA, with an emphasis on JIRA for most of our projects. Developers, Entrepreneurs, and other Project Owners will deploy contracts and add Workers. Through the TrustedOracle which is the PM, “an Issue” will be created. Once this happens, voting can be carried out on ProductBacklog and PlanningPoker Contracts.

Token Holders vote on issues in the ProductBacklog. They vote on the priority to be given to specific issues in the ProductBacklog which drive the development process. Workers can also vote on issue’s story points in the PlanningPoker. When the issue becomes closed, a Worker can get an award based on the story points of the issue.

The Crowdsale contract is where workers place sell orders for investors to buy tokens using ETH. These investors become token holders and can now vote on issue priority and also expect part of the future profits of the enterprise. This last aspect is something that is sorely missing in the mainstream ICO framework.

### Smart Contracts Protocol

Within the Scrum DAO ecosystem for project development, there are a number of contract types which execute different functions within the system. These contract types are as follows:

#### Project Contract
Project contract implements the ERC20 interface so that new tokens are only generated after a project development milestone has been successfully executed. The contributions of each participant are also recorded and rewarded. This incentivized framework ensures a degree of quality assurance and best practices with the project development process.

#### PlanningPoker Contract

Planning Poker is the main concept of scrum methodology. Team members (only) estimate tasks and the final average result represents the award amount. When a new task is added to the project management tool; TrustedOracle, a new sequence of voting is initialized. Voting closes when the issue goes from 'backlog' to 'in progress' status.

#### ProductBacklog Contract

This contract is similar to the PlanningPoker contract with the difference being that it is token holders who can vote. Each token holder’s vote has a weight value that is dependent on the token holder’s balance which is a percentage of the total number of tokens in circulation at that particular milestone. Voting in the ProductBacklog is an indication of the degree of interest the community has in the project development. Voting closes when the status of the Issue goes from ‘backlog’ to ‘in progress.’

#### Crowdsale Contract

This contract allows Workers to sell earned Tokens to anyone. It works like an order book on any exchange but with some differences:
 - Existing orders must be completely filled.
 - Only one order per transaction can be filled.
