## Applications


There are a number of potential applications of the Scrum DAO concept. These applications include:

### An alternative to ICOs
-------------
ICOs have created the false narrative that millions of dollars in crowdfunding is required to successfully implement a project. There are however numerous open source projects that exist and grow without the need for an unnecessary influx of investor funding.

By implementing and incentivized and collaborator project development framework, the Scrum DAO is better able to get investors to become involved in the development process. Investors can also track and monitor the progress of the project as well as vote on key issues that drive the actualization of the projectâ€™s goals.

It is also a way of sanitizing the blockchain startup market because only projects with viable economic and technical benefits will thrive in this particular framework. No more will pump and dump schemes be able to fleece investors of their hard earned money.

### Development of open source projects
-------------
A lot of viable projects do not get to see the light of day because they are unable to secure funding via venture capital methods. Using the Scrum DAO platform, open source projects can earn donations from the community and divide it fairly among team members.

### The distribution of shares among founders
-------------
By applying the Scrum DAO methodology to the business process, the contribution of founders, entrepreneurs, and developers can be rewarded. Their shares can be made to grow in relation to their contribution to the development of the business. This ensures a great deal of transparency and accountability, as well as introducing an incentive-based mechanism which encourages entrepreneurs to become more involved in the success of the business rather than just collecting investor funds. Shares can be sold to other members or to third party individuals.

### Rewarding employees
-------------
Companies can use the Scrum DAO construct to set up an incentivized workplace rewards system for their employees. Proprietary tokens can be generated for different purposes and be used as rewards for employees who contribute positively to the operations of the company.
