## Concept

The Scrum DAO it&#39;s an attempt to combine flexible software development methodology (Scrum) and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO).

We also want to offer a new approach to ICO to prevent over-inflating budget and greater involvement of investors in the development process. The idea is very simple - emit new tokens when some portion of work has been done and approved.
