## Problem Statement

It is true that in 2017, ICOs have become the chief crowdfunding means of choice for many startups. Many entrepreneurs instead of going through the many regulatory bottlenecks associated with IPOs and other mainstream venture capital activities now seem to prefer to go via the ICO route. Developers are introducing business models and concepts almost on a daily basis in order to take advantage of the popularity of the market.

This rise in popularity and the enormous amount of capital that has been accrued has raised fears of an ICO bubble much like the ‘dot com’ bubble of the 90s. With far fewer regulatory and statutory provisions that must be satisfied, it has become open season for individuals and organizations to flood the market with all sorts of projects. Many of these projects have little or no tangible economic merits leading to the term “pump and dump schemes.”

### Pump and Dump Schemes
-------------
Pump and dump schemes refer to ICOs in which investors are paying for basically just hype. The projects are introduced into the market to get investors to commit funds and after the ICO they don’t amount to any significant economic value.

The truth is that many, if not most of these ICOs are doomed to fail. They often are mediocre to low-quality projects with no hope of ever amounting to an economically viable enterprise.

### The ICO Bubble
-------------
ICOs represent an unsustainable crowdfunding process. The fact that startups don’t have to give up equity, coupled with the reality that many of these coin tokens actually amount to tokenized securities is a clear recipe for disaster. Even in the tightly regulated world of IPOs and other venture capital models, there are still instances of corporate malfeasance and other unsavory practices not to an unregulated market like ICOs which is basically a free for all.

### Lack of Investor Participation
-------------
The fact that investors do not participate in the development of the concept in the current ICO framework is against the spirit of the blockchain technology revolution. This has led to decreased levels of investor interest in the final product of these ICO campaigns. What most investors are interested in is how much they will get from the tokens after the project comes online. Some investors even go as far as exchanging the tokens for Bitcoin or Ether once there is a significant increase in the value of the ICO tokens.

The community and the investors also aren’t able to influence the final product. One important aspect of the blockchain ecosystem is the existence of a voice for each participant of the network. This is what decentralization is all about and it is sorely missing in the ICO framework which is just all about getting people to invest without those investors getting any equity or decision-making powers in return.
