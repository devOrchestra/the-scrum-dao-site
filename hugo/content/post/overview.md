## Concept
-------------

The Scrum DAO it&#39;s an attempt to combine flexible software development methodology (Scrum) and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO).

We also want to offer a new approach to ICO to prevent over-inflating budget and greater involvement of investors in the development process. The idea is very simple - emit new tokens when some portion of work has been done and approved.
The project capitalisation grows smoothly in parallel with features implementation and investors doesn't pay just for hype


## Integrations
-------------
In our plans do integration with most popular project management systems, eg JIRA, Github. In our projects we use JIRA and very like it, so we started with it.
