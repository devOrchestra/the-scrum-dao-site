## Conclusion

In terms of the roadmap, the Scrum DAO has no rigidly predetermined roadmap. After the beta release, the power to decide the features to be developed next will be delegated to the community. Members wishing to vote on issues can visit our backlog which can be found [here](https://devorchestra.atlassian.net/projects/SD/issues/SD-102?filter=allopenissues "here"). Members can also add new issues to the backlog.
Some of the features that we are interested in developing are as follows:

- Multiproject support
- Rewriting smart contracts on EOS
- GitLab implementation
- Delegating voting power
