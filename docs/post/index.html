<h2 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h2>

<p>It is true that in 2017, ICOs have become the chief crowdfunding means of choice for many startups. Many entrepreneurs instead of going through the many regulatory bottlenecks associated with IPOs and other mainstream venture capital activities now seem to prefer to go via the ICO route. Developers are introducing business models and concepts almost on a daily basis in order to take advantage of the popularity of the market.</p>

<p>This rise in popularity and the enormous amount of capital that has been accrued has raised fears of an ICO bubble much like the ‘dot com’ bubble of the 90s. With far fewer regulatory and statutory provisions that must be satisfied, it has become open season for individuals and organizations to flood the market with all sorts of projects. Many of these projects have little or no tangible economic merits leading to the term “pump and dump schemes.”</p>

<h3 id="pump-and-dump-schemes">Pump and Dump Schemes</h3>

<hr />

<p>Pump and dump schemes refer to ICOs in which investors are paying for basically just hype. The projects are introduced into the market to get investors to commit funds and after the ICO they don’t amount to any significant economic value.</p>

<p>The truth is that many, if not most of these ICOs are doomed to fail. They often are mediocre to low-quality projects with no hope of ever amounting to an economically viable enterprise.</p>

<h3 id="the-ico-bubble">The ICO Bubble</h3>

<hr />

<p>ICOs represent an unsustainable crowdfunding process. The fact that startups don’t have to give up equity, coupled with the reality that many of these coin tokens actually amount to tokenized securities is a clear recipe for disaster. Even in the tightly regulated world of IPOs and other venture capital models, there are still instances of corporate malfeasance and other unsavory practices not to an unregulated market like ICOs which is basically a free for all.</p>

<h3 id="lack-of-investor-participation">Lack of Investor Participation</h3>

<hr />

<p>The fact that investors do not participate in the development of the concept in the current ICO framework is against the spirit of the blockchain technology revolution. This has led to decreased levels of investor interest in the final product of these ICO campaigns. What most investors are interested in is how much they will get from the tokens after the project comes online. Some investors even go as far as exchanging the tokens for Bitcoin or Ether once there is a significant increase in the value of the ICO tokens.</p>

<p>The community and the investors also aren’t able to influence the final product. One important aspect of the blockchain ecosystem is the existence of a voice for each participant of the network. This is what decentralization is all about and it is sorely missing in the ICO framework which is just all about getting people to invest without those investors getting any equity or decision-making powers in return.</p>

<h2 id="our-solution">Our Solution</h2>

<p>With the number of ICO failures that have been recorded and the many faults inherent in the system, it is clearly apparent that an alternative approach is needed. The Scrum DAO offers an elegant and effective alternative to ICOs by combining our flexible software development methodology with a well-structured DAO framework.</p>

<h3 id="concept">Concept</h3>

<hr />

<p>In the Scrum DAO, all the stakeholders in the development process are brought together under one entity which allows for greater interaction between investors and developers. Instead of an ICO campaign that releases ‘X’ token for ‘Y’ dollars, a token release approach that follows the completion of incremental milestones will be followed. New tokens are only released when some portion of the development work has been completed and approved by the DAO.</p>

<p>With ICOs, startups push an idea to the public and invite investors to buy into the idea by purchasing tokens. When the capital has been raised, the entrepreneurs and developers work on the concept without any input from investors. In the Scrum DAO, investors only put up money based on the amount of work that has been completed and verified. In this way, the project capitalization grows smoothly and in parallel with the implementation of the features of the project. Investors aren’t just paying for hype.</p>

<h3 id="the-scrum-dao-ecosystem">The Scrum DAO Ecosystem</h3>

<hr />

<p>The Scrum DAO will be integrated with most of the popular project management systems like Github and JIRA, with an emphasis on JIRA for most of our projects. Developers, Entrepreneurs, and other Project Owners will deploy contracts and add Workers. Through the TrustedOracle which is the PM, “an Issue” will be created. Once this happens, voting can be carried out on ProductBacklog and PlanningPoker Contracts.</p>

<p>Token Holders vote on issues in the ProductBacklog. They vote on the priority to be given to specific issues in the ProductBacklog which drive the development process. Workers can also vote on issue’s story points in the PlanningPoker. When the issue becomes closed, a Worker can get an award based on the story points of the issue.</p>

<p>The Crowdsale contract is where workers place sell orders for investors to buy tokens using ETH. These investors become token holders and can now vote on issue priority and also expect part of the future profits of the enterprise. This last aspect is something that is sorely missing in the mainstream ICO framework.</p>

<p><img src="http://devorchestra.io/assets/images/presentation/scrum-dao-scheme.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="smart-contracts-protocol">Smart Contracts Protocol</h3>

<p>Within the Scrum DAO ecosystem for project development, there are a number of contract types which execute different functions within the system. These contract types are as follows:</p>

<h4 id="project-contract">Project Contract</h4>

<p>Project contract implements the ERC20 interface so that new tokens are only generated after a project development milestone has been successfully executed. The contributions of each participant are also recorded and rewarded. This incentivized framework ensures a degree of quality assurance and best practices with the project development process.</p>

<h4 id="planningpoker-contract">PlanningPoker Contract</h4>

<p>Planning Poker is the main concept of scrum methodology. Team members (only) estimate tasks and the final average result represents the award amount. When a new task is added to the project management tool; TrustedOracle, a new sequence of voting is initialized. Voting closes when the issue goes from &lsquo;backlog&rsquo; to &lsquo;in progress&rsquo; status.</p>

<h4 id="productbacklog-contract">ProductBacklog Contract</h4>

<p>This contract is similar to the PlanningPoker contract with the difference being that it is token holders who can vote. Each token holder’s vote has a weight value that is dependent on the token holder’s balance which is a percentage of the total number of tokens in circulation at that particular milestone. Voting in the ProductBacklog is an indication of the degree of interest the community has in the project development. Voting closes when the status of the Issue goes from ‘backlog’ to ‘in progress.’</p>

<h4 id="crowdsale-contract">Crowdsale Contract</h4>

<p>This contract allows Workers to sell earned Tokens to anyone. It works like an order book on any exchange but with some differences:
 - Existing orders must be completely filled.
 - Only one order per transaction can be filled.</p>

<h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>

<p>There are a number of potential applications of the Scrum DAO concept. These applications include:</p>

<h3 id="an-alternative-to-icos">An alternative to ICOs</h3>

<hr />

<p>ICOs have created the false narrative that millions of dollars in crowdfunding is required to successfully implement a project. There are however numerous open source projects that exist and grow without the need for an unnecessary influx of investor funding.</p>

<p>By implementing and incentivized and collaborator project development framework, the Scrum DAO is better able to get investors to become involved in the development process. Investors can also track and monitor the progress of the project as well as vote on key issues that drive the actualization of the project’s goals.</p>

<p>It is also a way of sanitizing the blockchain startup market because only projects with viable economic and technical benefits will thrive in this particular framework. No more will pump and dump schemes be able to fleece investors of their hard earned money.</p>

<h3 id="development-of-open-source-projects">Development of open source projects</h3>

<hr />

<p>A lot of viable projects do not get to see the light of day because they are unable to secure funding via venture capital methods. Using the Scrum DAO platform, open source projects can earn donations from the community and divide it fairly among team members.</p>

<h3 id="the-distribution-of-shares-among-founders">The distribution of shares among founders</h3>

<hr />

<p>By applying the Scrum DAO methodology to the business process, the contribution of founders, entrepreneurs, and developers can be rewarded. Their shares can be made to grow in relation to their contribution to the development of the business. This ensures a great deal of transparency and accountability, as well as introducing an incentive-based mechanism which encourages entrepreneurs to become more involved in the success of the business rather than just collecting investor funds. Shares can be sold to other members or to third party individuals.</p>

<h3 id="rewarding-employees">Rewarding employees</h3>

<hr />

<p>Companies can use the Scrum DAO construct to set up an incentivized workplace rewards system for their employees. Proprietary tokens can be generated for different purposes and be used as rewards for employees who contribute positively to the operations of the company.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In terms of the roadmap, the Scrum DAO has no rigidly predetermined roadmap. After the beta release, the power to decide the features to be developed next will be delegated to the community. Members wishing to vote on issues can visit our backlog which can be found <a href="https://devorchestra.atlassian.net/projects/SD/issues/SD-102?filter=allopenissues" title="here">here</a>. Members can also add new issues to the backlog.
Some of the features that we are interested in developing are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiproject support</li>
<li>Rewriting smart contracts on EOS</li>
<li>GitLab implementation</li>
<li>Delegating voting power</li>
</ul>
